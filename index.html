    <h3>About Me</h3>

        <img class="glass" src="./img/glass.jpeg" alt="glass mehndi image">
    <i><p>My interest in mehndi design began in childhood. When I was 15, I decided to apply mehndi on my own hand one day. A neighbor saw the design, admired it, and asked if I could apply mehndi on her hands as well. I eagerly agreed, and after completing the design, she complimented me, which sparked my passion for mehndi. From then on, I started applying mehndi for family and friends on various occasions. My confidence grew significantly when I received an order to design mehndi for a bride, who was very pleased with my work. This experience deepened my appreciation for the art of mehndi. Guided by my commitment to excellence, I am passionate about providing exceptional mehndi services that highlight the beauty and artistry of this timeless tradition. Let’s craft something special together!</p></i>

    <p>This section highlights a selection of mehndi designs I've created, featuring both intricate bridal patterns and elegant minimal styles. The bridal designs, showcasing full-hand mehndi, are detailed and elaborate, ideal for weddings and significant events, with traditional motifs and complex patterns. In contrast, the minimal styles offer a sophisticated, understated elegance with clean lines and subtle details, perfect for everyday wear or smaller occasions. Ultimately, the beauty of mehndi lies in its versatility; you can wear any design regardless of the occasion, allowing you to express your unique style and personality every day.</p>
